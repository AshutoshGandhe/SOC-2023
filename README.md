Traffic question:
The model definition had some key parameters, like the number of epochs, activation functions, pool size, etc
Some key observations:
1. Among 10 epochs, the accuracy of the model increased significantly after each epoch.
2. The activation functions relu and tanh worked quite well for this model, while sigmoid worked with a very low accuracy.
3. More dense layers increased the accuracy but also increased the computation time.
4. Increasing the dropout value comparatively decreased the accuracy.
5. Increasing the pool size comparatively decreased the accuracy and vice versa.
